            <p>The New California Republic (NCR) is a post-War federal republic founded in New California in 2189. The NCR was founded in a small town called Shady Sands, which is still the Capital of the NCR to this day.</p>

            <h2>Background up to New Vegas</h2>
            <p>The NCR had been through a lot before this point. It started small in Shady Sands, but grew to a point where it was spread so far that there was not enough people to guard and control the land they had taken. Raiders and Creatures of the Wastes would torment the poor civillians of the NCR and the NCR lacked manpower, gathering men and women from all over the territories. Then they landed upon the reminents of Las Vegas, now New Vegas, and the Hoover Dam that was still functional. Prior to when you start the story, They had fought and won a hard battle with Caesar's Legion at the Hoover Dam, and another Battle is on its way.</p>
